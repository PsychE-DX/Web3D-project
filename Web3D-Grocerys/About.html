    <div class="row">
      <!-- Left Side: Text Content -->
      <div class="col-md-8">

        <h2 style="color:#156082;font-weight: bold;">Geometry</h2>
        <p class="text">For this website I created 3 3D models of a carrot, apple and pepper. For each item I created
          two blender files, one with an animation attached and one with no animation. The models were created with a
          low poly count so that the load time for each model was minimal for the user. </a>
        <h2 style="color:#156082;font-weight: bold;">Lighting</h2>
        <p class="text">4 directional lights were created when loading the model with Three.js as well as an ambient
          light to smooth the shadows on the models. These lights were configured with their position as well as
          intensity in the Three.js editor before being introduced into the website.</p>
        <h2 style="color:#156082;font-weight: bold;">Cameras</h2>
        <p class="text">A perspective camera was created, with the aspect ratio determined by the container that held
          the model. Orbit controls were added to allow the user to view the models at any angle. </p>
        <h2 style="color:#156082;font-weight: bold;">Textures</h2>
        <p class="text">For the carrot and apple models there were two textures created, one was a simplistic base
          colour texture for the animation model with a realistic texture applied to the second model that is shown
          later to the user. Due to the limitations of the GLTF format, detailed colour mixes and gradients were not
          possible to export reducifont-weight: bold;ng the complexity available to the models. For all the models the stems were coloured
          with a separate texture to the rest of the model. Finally, the pepper model in the Store page rotates between
          red, green and yellow so allow the user to see each colour pepper available.</p>
        <h2 style="color:#156082;font-weight: bold;">Animations</h2>
        <p class="text">Again, due to the limitations of GLTF certain blender animation tools, such as animating with
          gravity or quick effects, could not be exported and viewed. To achieve the desired animations, I was required
          to manually place the objects where I wanted them to end up in each key frame.</p>
        <p class="text">In the apple animation there are two apples’ models, one that is not ‘sliced’ and the other
          which has been ‘sliced’. To transition between the two models, I shrunk and enlarged each model between 1
          frame to provide the illusion that the apple had been cut. I used this method again for the apple slicer to
          appear and disappear. To create the sliced apple, I created asterisk that is the length and width of the
          apple, then I used the Boolean modifier on the apple to remove the parts that the asterisk and the apple
          overlapped to create a ‘sliced’ apple. I then used the asterisk to create the slicer that falls when the
          animation is played. Finally, I manually positioned the different sections of the apple, after separating each
          section from the original model, to where I wanted them to fall after being sliced.</p>

      <h1 style="color:#02364e;font-weight: bold;">Design</h1>
      <h2 style="color:#156082;font-weight: bold;">Usability and Accessibility</h2>
      <p class="text">Buttons to interact with the website were designed to allow users with difficulties or mobile
        users to easily interact with the website. Moving between each page relies on the common practices of all online
        stores with a shopping cart signifying how to get to the page showing the items you have selected. Alt text on
        all sections is included as well as a high contrast between elements to help identification of different
        sections and buttons.</p>
      <h2 style="color:#156082;font-weight: bold;">Responsive and Look and Feel</h2>
      <p class="text">All pages utilised bootstrap to allow re-sizing to any screen or window size. The website has a
        consistent colour theme with all the buttons (other than empty basket) matching the website icon. The section
        the user is on is highlighted in the nav bar. When a user adds an item into their cart a number is shown, and
        this carries over and updates unless the user decides to empty their basket.</p>

      <h1 style="color:#02364e;font-weight: bold;">Integration</h1>
      <p class="text">To integrate my models, I used Three.js GLTFLoader which loaded the model as well as the
        animation. I also used Three.js AudioListener to load the sounds that I created using Adobe Audition. To match
        the audio and video in Adobe Audition I rendered each animation and exported it. This allowed me to cut the
        audio to sync to the timing of my animations. This required trimming and merging the audio files so that the
        sound occurred at the right time as well as speeding up some sounds to match the speed of the animations. I
        created a icon for the website which using favicon.io I used the website identifier. A shopping cart icon was
        also created to link the two pages together.</p>
      <div class="container-fluid py-5">
        <div class="row">
          <!-- Left Side: Text Content -->
          <div class="col-md-8 px-4">
            <h1 style="color:#02364e;font-weight: bold;">Interaction</h1>
            <h2 style="color:#156082;font-weight: bold;">Manipulation and viewing of 3D models</h2>
            <p class="text">As stated, before I used orbit controls to allow the user to view the models from all sides
              as well as a wireframe button to view each model’s wireframe. When the user presses the + to add the item
              to the cart the animation and sound are played before hiding the model. When a model is added to the cart
              a counter is increased in the localStorage. This is used in the Store page and the cart counter to
              determine the amount and what has been selected. The models are all loaded when the user chooses which
              item they want to view and are all hidden when they are not selected. A swap item button is added to allow
              the user to switch between each item when they have selected a model. The wireframe and swap model buttons
              are hidden when an object is not selected, and all buttons are greyed out when the + is pressed so to not
              have overlapping models.</p>
            <h2 style="color:#156082;font-weight: bold;">Interactivities in all the other pages</h2>
            <p class="text">In the Store page the models that have been selected are shown here and can be clicked on to
              show the price comparison. This changes the colour of the background for the model to show the viewer
              which one is currently selected. This changes when another item is selected. The amount the user has
              selected an item affects the price comparison with the total price for the number selected is shown as
              well as the price for a single item. I used grid display to place all the containers on all pages
              correctly as well as placing each container next to each other when they are loaded on the store page.
              Hover effects are included on all interactable as well as the unavailable elements being greyed out and
              unavailable to be interacted with. A search feature is included in the shop page to allow the user to find
              a specific item with the use of this feature increasing with more items being available.</p>

      <h2 style="color:#156082;font-weight: bold;">Testing</h2>
      <p class="text">I performed functional testing to make sure that the page works as intended on multiple
        applications (Firefox, google chrome, edge, etc) as well as testing the product on mobile devices. I have
        conducted an anonymous survey which includes questions on the functionality of the website as well as the design
        and interaction. </p>
      <h2 style="color:#156082;font-weight: bold;">Outcomes</h2>
      <p class="text">The functional testing concluded that all browsers work as intended with the website however,
        testing on mobile devices showed that the selection of the item in the Store page was unavailable with a
        touchscreen press. This outcome was unexpected as the ‘click’ event listener was used to check when a container
        was clicked. This is the same event listener used with the buttons which worked with a touch screen.</p>
      <p class="text">The survey results showed a high amount of positive feedback for the UI, navigation and
        interactivities of the website with quotes: ‘I like the animation, it was fun to play around with’ and ‘I found
        it easy to navigate and I enjoyed the price comparison aspect’. An improvement that was suggested included more
        items, ability to swap directly to a model they wanted to rather than clicking the swap model button and the
        ability to view the list of chosen fruit in the basket. One of the responders stated that the website ‘feels a
        little too minimal’.</p>
